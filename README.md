## Security
Bedrock Payment HTTP provides API endpoints for payments that require a user is logged in. Additional checks are made to ensure that the payment being processed was created by the account in the current session.

## Background
Bedrock Payment HTTP was created in order to provide an easy to use and secure API for payments from multiple payment gateways (i.e. paypal, stripe, etc.).

## Install

```sh
npm install bedrock-payment-http --save
```

## Usage
You can configure bedrock-payment-http by requiring a config file like this

```js
const bedrock = require('bedrock');
const path = require('path');

const {config} = bedrock;
const cfg = config['payment-http'];

const basePath = '/payment';

cfg.routes = {
  basePath
};
```

## API
This module adds several new API endpoints to your bedrock server.
the basePath defaults to /payment
